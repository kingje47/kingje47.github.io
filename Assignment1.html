I suppose it's only a matter of time before I'm affected, too. Well, my mind is getting hazy... Please let me hear the sound of the flute one last time. You are perhaps the last one to carry on the blood-line of the Knights... It is ironic that the last one in the line has the potential to become the Hero of legend. The man who last claimed the Power Of Gold wished for this world. It reflects his heart. Yes, I came here because of greed for the Golden Power, and look what happened to me... But what a mischievous thing to leave lying around... The Power Of Gold... Triforce... 
<br><br>
But then, a day came when a fell wind began to blow across the kingdom... With its strength, he commanded darkness across the kingdom... But then, when all hope had died and the hour of doom was at hand, a young boy in green appeared as if from nowhere... The boy's tale was passed down through generations until it became legend... But one day, a man of great evil found the golden power and took it for himself... 
<br><br>
I underestimated that boy. Can Hyrule's destiny really depend on such a lazy boy? Heh heh heh... You want a piece of me?! Very funny! I like your attitude! Listen! ! Who...? Who are you? How did you get past the guards?
